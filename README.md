Playlist Project

	This is the Playlist Project, in which we create the classes 'SONG' and 'PLAYLIST' to allow manipulation of a desired list of SONG objects.
	It allows the user to add songs as desired to the playlist, like and unlike songs and (if you really don't like that one song that always comes up) to remove a song from the list. 
	In case you really have to listen to only music you like, you can also remove every song that hasn't been liked from the list. 
	Happy music-ing!
